This repository contains several sample setups to do Continuous Integration of web apps and web projects with [Buildbot](http://buildbot.net).

Each directory represents a sample configuration and provides a README.md file with details on the use case.

A blog story to introduce the service: [Continuous integration of webapps with Buildbot](http://danir.us/blog/stories/2013/apr/30/continuous-integration-web-apps-buildbot/).

If you have a new use case feel free to add it.
